A low blood sugar level, also called hypoglycaemia or a "hypo", is where the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood drops too low. It mainly affects people with diabetes, especially if they take insulin. A low blood sugar level can be dangerous if it's not treated quickly, but you can usually treat it easily yourself.
